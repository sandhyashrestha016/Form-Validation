            Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a
            newly discovered coronavirus. Most people infected with the COVID-19
            virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and
            recover without requiring special treatment. Older people, and those
            with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease,
            diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to
            develop serious illness.<br /><br />

            The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well
            informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it
            spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your
            hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your
            face. <br />

            The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or
            discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes,
            so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for
            example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).<br />

            At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for
            COVID-19. However, there are many ongoing clinical trials evaluating
            potential treatments.

          alcohol-based hand rub.<br />
          Maintain at least 1 metre distance between you and people coughing or
          sneezing.<br />

          Seek immediate medical attention if you have serious symptoms. Always
          call before visiting your doctor or health facility. <br />

          People with mild symptoms who are otherwise healthy should manage
          their symptoms at home. <br /><br />

          On average it takes 5–6 days from when someone is infected with the
          virus for symptoms to show, however it can take up to 14 days. <br />
